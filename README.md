Exploring the world of design patterns (OOP)!

## My Understanding & Motivation

In software development, the same problem can be solved in _many_ different ways. While it is not fair to say a solution is _wrong_, each solution can be assessed against certain criteria. Some valid criteria are:

- I want the shortest solution possible!
- I want the most efficient solution possible!
- I want a solution which can be easily _extended_ because I know the requirements will grow as time goes!
- and so on.

In Object Oriented Programming (OOP), there are certain criteria that most people agree to be **good** criteria, meaning if a solution satisfies these conditions, it can be deemed to be a **good** solution from OOP's point of view. These criteria or principles are called SOLID principles, which is a mnemonic for five criteria that will make the software "good" if followed.

At the same time, software developers discovered that a lot of the real world problems are somewhat similar, if we only look at the core of the problems. This means that the software that try to solve these problems can share some similarities, or in other words, there are _patterns_ that we can use to solve these problems. Back in the 90s, a group of software developers, the Gang of Four, extensively studied some of the good patterns (which follow SOLID principles) and published a book.

While mindlessly using these design patterns is pretty dumb, there are times where these patterns really work well and solve the problem brilliantly. Also, a lot of the libraries and frameworks out there use these patterns, so knowing these patterns really help us understand those better. Lastly, studying these patterns are a great way to learn to think in the OOP way.

So let's go!
